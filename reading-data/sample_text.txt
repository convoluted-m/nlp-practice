Our garden is an enchanted garden.

It is wide and open, sloping gently down to a cosmic-blue river. Apple trees run through the centre of the garden, casting a lake of claw shadows onto the grass. In autumn, the fiery brilliance of their leaves is a sight: scorching-oranges, burning-browns and molten-reds.
